# track2-explorations

**NOTE:** Pointers to our latest version of the curriculum can be found in the [installfest](https://github.com/clojurebridge-minneapolis/installfest) repo!

## Background

This respository was used to collect documentation and ideas
for the Track 2 "unstructured" hacking time at ClojureBridge.

We will decide, in real time, which of these ideas (or others) to
dive into (either individually or as a group).

## Practical Explorations
